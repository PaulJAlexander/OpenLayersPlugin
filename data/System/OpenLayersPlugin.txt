Plugin preferences should be set using =configure=, as described in
%SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins. You can also use
[[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]] to define any
user-controllable configuration. You are strongly advised
to use the name of the plugin as a prefix, to avoid the risk of namespace
clashes with other extensions that may try to use the same name.
